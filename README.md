# Personal Portfolio

This is the same portfolio code that I previously shared. However, I did not host this version because the original repository contains an environment variable for an API key, which I did not want to expose publicly.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- node js, tailwind, express js, react js, mongo db
- API Integration (secured via `.env`)

## Detail
- **MongoDB** â€“ Data storage (optional: user submissions, writing history)
- **Express.js** â€“ Backend framework
- **React.js** â€“ Frontend UI
- **Node.js** â€“ Runtime environment

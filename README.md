This is the same portfolio code that I previously shared. However, I did not host this version because the original repository contains an environment variable for an API key, which I did not want to expose publicly.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- node js, tailwind, express js, react js, mongo db
- API Integration (secured via `.env`)
